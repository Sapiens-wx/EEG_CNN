# Preprocessed Data

This folder contains preprocessed EEG data ready for training or evaluation.

# For Training
You can create subfolders inside this directory to organize your files. However, only the files directly in this folder will be processed unless explicitly provided as arguments for [`train_model.py`](../train_model.py).

It is a recommended practice to keep the preprocessed data organized and well-documented for future reference or retraining.
